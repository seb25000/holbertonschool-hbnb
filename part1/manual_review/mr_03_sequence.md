### Rubric for Task 3: Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

| **Criteria**                        | **Points** | **Description**                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accurate Sequence of Interactions** | **0-3**    | 0: Missing or incorrect sequence of interactions for the API calls.<br>1-2: Some steps missing or incorrectly ordered.<br>3: All steps in the sequence are accurately represented for each API call, showing the correct order of interactions between layers. |
| **Correct Representation of Layers** | **0-2**    | 0: Layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence) are missing or incorrectly represented.<br>1: Layers are present but not clearly distinguished.<br>2: All three layers are correctly represented and clearly distinguished in the diagrams. |
| **Clarity of Messages and Methods** | **0-2**    | 0: Messages and method calls are missing or unclear.<br>1: Some messages and method calls are present but lack clarity or correctness.<br>2: All messages and method calls are clearly labeled and correctly correspond to their respective layers and components. |
| **Consistency Across Diagrams**     | **0-2**    | 0: Diagrams are inconsistent in structure or notation.<br>1: Diagrams show some inconsistencies (e.g., missing components or differing notations).<br>2: Diagrams are consistent in style, structure, and notation, ensuring a uniform presentation. |
| **Diagram Readability and Aesthetics**| **0-1**    | 0: Diagrams are difficult to read or follow.<br>1: Diagrams are clear, well-organized, and easy to understand, with proper spacing and alignment of components. |

### Total Points: **0-10**

- **0-3 Points**: Major steps or layers missing, incorrect sequences, or unclear messages.
- **4-6 Points**: Some correct elements, but with gaps or lack of clarity in the interaction sequences or messages.
- **7-9 Points**: Mostly accurate, with minor issues in clarity, consistency, or completeness.
- **10 Points**: Complete, clear, and well-structured sequence diagrams that accurately reflect the flow of operations across the layers for each API call.
