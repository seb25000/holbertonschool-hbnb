| **Entity Representation**           | **0-3**    | 0: Key entities (User, Place, Review, Amenity) are missing.<br>1-2: Entities are present but lack key attributes or methods.<br>3: All key entities are present, with clear attributes and methods that reflect the business requirements. |
| **Attributes and Methods Accuracy** | **0-3**    | 0: Missing or incorrect attributes and methods.<br>1-2: Some attributes or methods are missing, incorrect, or incomplete.<br>3: All entities have accurate attributes (UUID4, timestamps, etc.) and methods reflecting their responsibilities. |
| **Relationship Representation**     | **0-2**    | 0: Relationships between entities are missing or incorrect.<br>1: Relationships are present but unclear or incomplete.<br>2: All relevant relationships (associations, compositions, inheritance) between entities are correctly represented using proper UML notation. |
| **Use of Multiplicity and Associations** | **0-1** | 0: Multiplicity and associations not shown or incorrect.<br>1: Correct and clear use of multiplicity and associations to define entity relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many). |
| **Diagram Readability and Aesthetics**| **0-1**    | 0: Diagram is difficult to read or follow.<br>1: Diagram is clear, with properly labeled entities, methods, and relationships, and follows UML conventions. |
