### Rubric for Task 1: High-Level Package Diagram (3-Layer Architecture with Facade Pattern)

| **Criteria**                        | **Points** | **Description**                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity and Structure of the Layers** | **0-3**    | 0: Missing or unclear layer representation.<br>1-2: Layers present but poorly structured or confusing.<br>3: Clear representation of all three layers (Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence) with distinct separation between them. |
| **Correct Use of Facade Pattern**   | **0-2**    | 0: Facade pattern not represented or incorrect.<br>1: Facade pattern represented but unclear or incomplete.<br>2: Facade pattern clearly shown as the interface for interaction between layers. |
| **Identification of Key Components**| **0-2**    | 0: Missing key components within the layers.<br>1: Some key components identified but not exhaustive.<br>2: All essential components (ServiceAPI, Models, DatabaseAccess) correctly identified within each layer. |
| **Communication Between Layers**    | **0-2**    | 0: Communication pathways missing or incorrect.<br>1: Communication paths present but unclear.<br>2: Clear and accurate depiction of interactions between layers, including facade as a mediator. |
| **Diagram Readability and Aesthetics**| **0-1**    | 0: Diagram is confusing or difficult to read.<br>1: Diagram is easy to follow with proper labels, spacing, and overall clarity. |

### Total Points: **0-10**

- **0-3 Points**: Major issues in representing layers or facade pattern; lack of key components.
- **4-6 Points**: Some correct elements but with notable gaps or unclear areas.
- **7-9 Points**: Mostly correct, with minor issues in clarity or completeness.
- **10 Points**: Complete, clear, and well-structured package diagram accurately representing the architecture and facade pattern.
